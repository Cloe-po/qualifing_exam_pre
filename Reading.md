#### Question: 
##### Do the "shaming" activities of HROs (human rights international non-governmental organization direct influence on state behavior? HRO（人权国际非政府组织）的“羞辱”活动是否直接影响国家行为？

#### Results: 
##### 1.States targed or "shamed" by these organizations do improve their human rights practices. 被这些组织攻击或“羞辱”的国家确实改善了他们的人权实践。
##### 2.Improvements in human rights practices result from the interaction of shaming by HR a domestic presence of HROs within the targeted state and/or (ii) pressure by third-party states, and organizations. 人权实践的改善是由于人权组织羞辱目标国家的国内人权组织和/或（ii）第三方国家和组织的压力的相互作用。

#### Theory:
##### 1.Keck and Sikkink (1998:92) points out "initial research suggests that international and domestic non-governmental organizations(NGOs)paly a central role in" in transnational advocacy.“初步研究表明，国际和国内非政府组织（NGO）在”跨国宣传中发挥着核心作用。
##### 2.Much HRO literature focuses on how individual HROs try to persuade actors to adopt human rights norms through shaming activities.许多 HRO 文献都关注个别 HRO 如何通过羞辱活动来说服行为者采纳人权规范。
##### 3.Improvements in human rights practices depend critically on the simultaneous actions of many different advocacy actors.人权实践的改进在很大程度上取决于许多不同倡导者的同时行动。
##### 4. Spiral model: The Spiral Model posits that conflicts arise from punishment applied in the false expectation that it will elicit better behavior from the other side, when in fact it elicits worse behavior.螺旋模型假设冲突源于惩罚的错误期望，即惩罚会引发另一方更好的行为，而实际上它会引发更糟糕的行为。
##### 5. Boomerang model: domestic groups seek to bring their human rights issues to the attention of HROs...Their boomerang model is an international relations collective action theory that creates a framework for how an advocacy movement travels from one country to another through different actors. In their model, blockages exist between domestic NGOs and their domestic governments.他们的回旋镖模型是一种国际关系集体行动理论，它为倡导运动如何通过不同的参与者从一个国家传播到另一个国家创造了一个框架。 在他们的模型中，国内非政府组织与其国内政府之间存在障碍。

#### Data(if any):
##### 1. A new data set of the shaming activities of more than 400 HROs toward governments 400 多个 HRO 羞辱政府活动的新数据集
##### 2. New daata on the domestic presence of HROs and the targeting of governments by outside advocacy forces关于 HRO 在国内的存在以及外部宣传力量针对政府的新数据

#### Contribution:
##### 1. improve existing empirical measures of HRO activities
##### 2. finding results
##### 3. findings underscore the importance of the reputation mechanism throough which improvements in human rights occur

#### Hypothese
##### (1)Shaming by HROs alone does not lead to improved human rights performance.仅 HRO 的羞辱并不能改善人权绩效。
##### (2)When shaming by HROs is coupled with large numbers of HROs within the targeted state, it should lead to greater respect for human rights. 当 HRO 的羞辱与目标国家内的大量 HRO 相结合时，应该会导致对人权的更大尊重。
##### (3)Shaming by HROs，when interacted or coupled with targeting by third-party actors,lead to greater respect for human rights.HRO 的羞辱，当与第三方行为者互动或结合时，会导致对人权的更大尊重。
##### (4)Shaming by HROs, when interacted or coupled with targeting by third-party actors plus large numbers of HROs within the targeted state, leads to greater respect for human rights.HRO 的羞辱，当与第三方行为者以及目标国家内的大量 HRO 的目标互动或结合时，会导致对人权的更大尊重。


#### Reflection: 
##### The conception of an INGO is minimally defined as any nonprofit, open membership, transparent, and legal organization with a presence in more than one state. This is the definition agreed to in the Yearbook of International Organizations, the standard reference on INGOs (UIA 2008-2009）. The improvements in human rights practices result from the interaction of shaming by HROs with (1) large number of HROs present within the states and they help social movements and improved human rihts "from below;"(Brysk 1993) (2)shaming of the regimes by third parties, individuals and organizations, increases the pressure "from above"(Brysk 1993).
